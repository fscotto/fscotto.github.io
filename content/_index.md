# Hi, I'm Fabio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with almost ten years of experience.  
I work as a consultant developing backend with Quarkus Framework in partnership with **[Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com)**.  
I like to study new technologies especially related to cloud, operating systems and programming languages, I love GNU/Linux which is my primary operating system for work (Windows sucks).

Besides programming I enjoy music and anime.
